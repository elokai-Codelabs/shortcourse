        UNDERSTANDING BAPTISM
The English word “Baptism” is a derivative of the Greek word “baptisma (noun) or baptizo (verb)” which is translated literally as “To immerse or dip something into something”. Biblically, Baptism means a person is dead for sin, and has resurrected again to walk in the newness of life found in Christ
“Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.” Matthew 28:19. 
“And he said unto them, go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature. He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.”
So, we have the importance of Baptism in these two texts. Ellen White wrote that,
That baptism does not consist merely in an outward form is indicated in 1 Corinthians 12:13: “For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.” It is true here as elsewhere that “the body is of Christ;” and that this is the body into which we are baptized, is positively stated in Galatians 3:27, where we read, “For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.” Thus, we are taught that baptism is that by which we become Christ’s, and heirs according to the promise. It is that by which we get into Christ, who is the Door of salvation. Being baptized into his body is being joined to His church, for the church is the body of Christ. Ephesians 1:22,23 and Colossians 1:18. And since it is by his Spirit that this union is effected, it is evident that baptism is something more than a mere form, and that only those are members of the true church of Christ who have the Spirit of Christ. See Romans 8:9. This must not by any means be understood as depreciating literal baptism or union with the visible church. We only wish to emphasize the fact that the simple form is not all.
Since it is by baptism that we become united to Christ,—“put on Christ,”—a very important question is, At what point do we come into contact with Christ or become united with Him? Let us read Romans 6:3,4 “Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into His death? Therefore, we are buried with Him by baptism into death; that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.” 
The death of Christ, then, is that by which we become united to Him. Just as in ordinary marriage two persons are united, so that they are no longer two, but “one flesh,” so in putting on Christ we become one with Him. 
Baptism signifies our acceptance of Christ Sacrifice; In order to get His life, we must acknowledge that our life is lost and the one we owe now is not for us, hence there is no righteousness in us that can contribute to our redemption.
Knowing that for the wages of sin is death, death sentence has already been pronounced upon us because, we have sold our life to Satan. As the scripture says  in John 3:36 that He that believeth in the Son has everlasting life and he that believeth not the Son has no life, we as sinners have no life of our own, and so we must be willing to surrender our old nature into the hands of Christ in order that we may receive His life in exchange.
Your old nature are the things you know are not Christ-like, the addictions, anger and the other behaviour you have repeatedly try to overcome them and get rid of them but have not been able to do so.
Now at baptism, you say that, 
Here I am O Lord, Let the power in your death and resurrection take my old life and consecrate me with your righteousness, that I may become a new person to walk in thy precept.
Take my life, and let it be
 Consecrated, Lord, to Thee. 
Take my hands, and let them move
 At the impulse of Thy love,
 At the impulse of Thy love.

Take my love; my Lord, I pour
 At Thy feet, its treasure store.
 Take myself, and I will be,
 Ever, only, all for Thee, 
Ever, only, all for Thee      (SDAH 330)
THE TWO PATHWAYS TO HEAVEN
In John 3:5, (Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.) Jesus gave Nikodemus two ways by which a person can enter the kingdom of God; Baptism by water and the holy spirit.
1.	BAPTISM BY WATER.
The water baptism or John the Baptist baptism is the also the same as baptism unto repentance. This is the outward physical sign that a person is convicted and has decided to follow Jesus. This baptism joins the believer to the body of Christ (1 Corinthians 12:13). That is, it accepts the believer officially into the church of God. 
2.	BAPTISM OF THE HOLY SPIRIT/JESUS CHRIST BAPTISM.
After the believer has accepted Christ, the desire for sin has not been taken away, so the believer’s mind and everything is subjected to sin even though they have decided to do what is right. So, Jesus Christ put His Holy Spirit into the person so that the mind of the person can be set on higher things not on the corruptible things in this world. So, it if the Holy spirit that strengthens the believer to reflect Christ be continually doing the will of God. (Phil. 4:13, “For I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me)
The spirit will turn their hearts from the love of sin and pleasure to the love of God, so that they may lead a give themselves to a life of prayer and holiness, of meekness, purity, and benevolence. And this will establish a connection in their hearts towards Christ and a reason why they can enter the kingdom of Heaven.
“If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God. Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth. For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.” Col. 3:1-3
“But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.” 1 Cor 15:10. 
“Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.” Romans 6:6
“That ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts; and be renewed in the spirit of your mind; and that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.” Eph. 4:22-24
“Therefore, if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature; old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new. And all things are of God.” 2 Cor. 5:17,18.
THE THIEF ON THE CROSS.
Sometimes people argue that if it is true that baptism is a way of salvation, then what of the thief on the cross. 
Ephesians 2:8 “For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God”
Hebrews 11:6 “But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.”
Matthew 7:21 “Not everyone that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.”
The baptism of Jesus was not only to be a guidance for the biblical mode of baptism but also to cover the sins of those who cannot be baptised but accepted Jesus by faith. The faith in Jesus will credit such person an assurance of Salvation even if the person dies in Christ without baptism.
So even if a person accepted Christ in a vehicle and decide to get baptise and the vehicle get an accident which resulted in the death of the person, the faith the person had in Christ will credit salvation to the person even though the person could not go into water for baptism.
THE MODES OF BAPTISM.
There are numerous modes at which people get baptised (immersion and by sprinkling) but only one is genuine from the biblical point of view. (One Lord, one faith, one baptism.” Ephesians 4:5) So how can we find the genuine one? Look carefully at Paul’s description of the beautiful ceremony and what it actually represents: “Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life  knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.” Romans 6:4-6. 
Now that body of evil must be properly disposed of, and Paul says baptism is the occasion for “burying” that crucified nature. By going into the water to conduct a spiritual funeral and to celebrate the new life which has been begotten in the candidate through the Holy Spirit, Paul says we are also memorializing the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Himself. Christ himself was immersed in water and it is that principle he taught his disciples. Philip in Act 8 baptised the Ethiopian Eunuch in the same way. So, baptism by immersion is the true biblical mode of baptism. Originally, the baptism of immersion was done in living or flowing water (river) as an indication of washing away the sins far away to the deep sea. But due to the differences in weather and accessibility of water, some churches though go by the method of immersion baptised in a pool or in a dug well. The approach whether in a dug well, a pool or in a river does not matter but the water must cover the person. But since Christ our Saviour was baptised in a river, it is more appropriate to do same provided there is a river available.
WHO QUALIFIES FOR BAPTISM?
The Bible lays down three pre-conditions for anyone contemplating this step. Jesus said, “Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you.” Matthew 28:19, 20.
Since baptism is an outward witness of conversion, Christ stipulated that every candidate should be instructed in his basic doctrines before entering the water of baptism. They would need to fully understand God's plan of Salvation and the meaning of what they are doing. The Bible does not give any age range but people who can understand God's plan of salvation, distinguish between good and bad and with faith In Christ subject themselves for baptism are eligible.
It is very sad if you ask someone, “have you been baptised?” and the person will tell you, “let me go and ask my mother if I have been baptised” Your parents do not have to tell you that you have been baptised before you will know but you must know and appreciate it yourself.
REBAPTISM 
And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper coasts came to Ephesus: and finding certain disciples, He said unto them, Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed? And they said unto him, we have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost. And he said unto them, unto what then were ye baptized? And they said, Unto John’s baptism. Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe on him which should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus. When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.” (Act 19:1-5).
Observe carefully that the baptism of John was not strictly Christian baptism. It was the baptism of repentance; a baptism designed to prepare the way for the introduction of the kingdom of the Messiah that is why they lack the knowledge concerning the Holy Spirit of Christ. It was just telling them to believe the one who is after him and that is Jesus Christ. So, Paul message made them feel the need to be baptised again to receive the spirit of Christ.
So, if one discovers that his first baptism was not in harmony with the example of Jesus, he should submit to the proper form to fulfil “all righteousness”. Sprinkling, for example, although performed under the name of baptism, could never meet the required symbolism of death and burial. This means that babies, regardless of the sincerity of their parents or godparents, must be considered unbaptized until they take the step after their own spiritual awakening at a responsible age.
THE CALL TO REMEMBRANCE
John 13:4-5 “He riseth from supper and laid aside his garments; and took a towel and girded himself. After that he poureth water into a bason, and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded.
Luke 22:14, 17-19 “And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles with him. And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, Take this, and divide it among yourselves: For I say unto you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God shall come. And he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave unto them, saying, this is my body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me.”
But if you have been baptised already unto Christ, Jesus gave another sacrament to be a remembrance of His death and resurrection and that is the Communion service. If we carefully observe the Communion service, the two forms of baptism are clearly highlighted.
1.	The washing of feet
Exodus 14:21-22 “And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the LORD caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided. And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground: and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left.”  
1 Corinthians 10:1-4 “Moreover, brethren, I would not that ye should be ignorant, how that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea;  And were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea;  And did all eat the same spiritual meat;  And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ.”
So, from the above text, we see that the washing of feet was a form of baptism (because all the Israelite who passed through the red sea were baptised.) that represent the water baptism Jesus told Nikodemus. Note that all those who believe the voice of God (Israelites) were saves while those who will harden their heart in the sins (Egyptians) will perish. We must just learn to obey without complaining we are sinners so we cannot go and take communion, Christ want us to just obey, ask for forgiveness and perform this sacrament.
2.	The Bread.
The bread represents the body of Christ that we will be joined to if we only accept Him and surrender all our old life to him. As we eat of the bread, Christ add us to his church
3.	The Blood.
The blood of Jesus will give pardon to a sinner to inherit eternal life.
So, all these instances help to rekindle or restrengthen the relationship that the first baptism we have had before (water and the holy spirit baptism) has given us. No one can prevent you from rebaptism but what matters is that your heart must have a connection to Christ in baptism. Hence, once you are baptised unto Christ, unless you have been suspended from the Church and accepted you again. Communion is what Christ said the disciples should take to remind his death and resurrection.
