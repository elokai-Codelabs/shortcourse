        THE SPEAKING OF TONGUES?
Tongue in the Bible represent a language. All the Spiritual gifts Christ gave out to different people are supposed to work together to make fully the body of Christ.
In Matthew 28:19-20, “Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:  Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world.”  
The disciples cannot teach all nations if they know of only one language. Therefore God promised them a unique gift from the Holy spirit and that is the gift of tongue (The gift to speak language you do not know or have studied) so that they can spread the gospel, and that is why it was recorded in Mark 16:17 that “And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues”  
This means that the ability to speak in different tongues cannot be a normal way of speaking but rather a periodic gift to speak fluently in a language that you are not familiar with. We shall look at three major instances for which tongues was mentioned in the Bible.
1.	THE DAY OF PENTECOST.
Acts 2:1-4 “And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place.  And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.  And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them.  And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance”.  
Why did Jesus wait until Pentecost before giving the gift of tongues to the believers?
	Acts 2:5-11 “And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven.  Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because that every man heard them speak in his own language.  And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying one to another, Behold, are not all these which speak Galileans?  And how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were born?  Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judaea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia,  Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes,  Cretes and Arabians, we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God”. 
Pentecost is a Jewish feast which is celebrated 50 days after the Passover. So, all devoted believers will come from different part of the world to worship in Jerusalem. And these people have different languages for which they all speak. So, it was very difficult to communicate to them in the native language of the Jews (Aramaic). So, the holy spirit of God changed their local language to a one that all the people from different part of the world can hear and understand in their own language. So, when they heard that, the spirit of God pierced through their heart to accept the everlasting truth.
So, note that the gift of tongues came only when there are various languages and God also want to communicate His message to all of them at the same time.
2.	CORNELIUS AND HIS HOUSEHOLD
Acts 10:1,44-46 “There was a certain man in Caesarea called Cornelius, a centurion of the band called the Italian band;  While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word.  And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost.  For they heard them speak with tongues and magnify God. 
We know from the above text that Cornelius was an Italian and Peter a Jew who speak Aramaic. Once they are from different places there must be an interpreter before they can communicate very well. So, the Holy spirit fell on Cornelius and His household and they all understood Peter’s preaching and hence they magnified God. Peter also understood their language under the influence of the Holy spirit. 
When Peter was telling the other disciples in Acts 11:1 that “And as I began to speak, the Holy Ghost fell on them, as on us at the beginning”.  The beginning that Peter is using here represent what happened on the Day of Pentecost. So, we also see here that the same gift of tongue came when there was a language barrier as it was on the day of Pentecost.
3.	PAUL IN EPHESUS
Acts 19:6 “And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came on them; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied”.  
Reading from verse 1-5, Paul in Ephesus met some 12 disciples who were baptised unto John the Baptist (SEE DETAILS IN THE CHAPTER OF BAPTISM). When Paul baptised them unto Christ Paul realized there were speaking another language which is uncommon in the Roman empire. Someone may ask “How was Paul able to detect that We are told that 1 Corinthians 14:18 (I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than ye all) that Paul speak several languages than the other people in the Roman Empire.
Do not forget that tongue was a gift from God to break communication barrier. 
Acts 4:31 “And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they spake the word of God with boldness”.  
We see from the above text that even though the disciples were all praying together, but after the Holy spirit came, the spake with boldness without any different tongue because there was no foreigner among them.
PAUL FIRST LETTER TO THE CORINTHIANS
1 Corinthians 14:27-28 “If any man speaks in an unknown tongue, let it be by two, or at the most by three, and that by course; and let one interpret.  But if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God”  
Why is it that of all the 14 books Paul wrote in the new Testament, only the book of Corinthians deals with tongues? The Ancient city of Corinth has two international seaports for it trading activities hence housing people from different nations. 
1.	Because of this when believers among them meet for worship, others will sing, pray, and preach in a language unknown to the others who are present and vice versa. So that is why Paul is saying if there is no person to interpret the language, they should keep silence in the church. So, the unknown means what you understand but the others do not.
2.	Also, Paul said the person should speak to himself and to God. Meaning if you speak in any language that only you understand, you speak to yourself and God because apart from you who understand the language, only God can understand what you are trying to say. So, the church (other people apart from you) will not benefit from what you are saying and that is what Paul termed it as progress of the Church. 
In fact on the football field, not all the players defend all strike, some defend while others are striking, so in the Church not all of us can sing, preach or speak in tongues unless God grant it unto us. So, we should be careful of how we interpret certain biblical statement.
THE HEAVENLY LANGUAGE
1 Corinthians 14:14 “For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful”.  
Most at times when you ask people why do you speak in this unknown tongue, they will tell you it is a heavenly language that the devil cannot understand, and their reason is the above text in 1 Cor 14:14. What Paul is saying here is that, If he speaks in any language that the people around them do not understand, he is praying with his spirit alright but what he is saying is unfruitful not to himself but those around who are listening to  him because they do not understand what he want to say. For instance, if you pray in Ewe to an Ashanti, your spirit will be uplifted alright but the person listening to your prayer will not benefit anything. Sometimes they do not even follow what you are saying and mostly they will only say Amen when they see you have finished talking or they heard you are saying Amen.
There is no place in the Bible where we are told a way to hide our prayers from Satan, but Satan always tremble when he hears the fervent prayer of a Christian. We must take every context of the Bible into consideration before making a judgement. If we consider these three statements of Paul, if you do not carefully observe it, you can easily make hasty conclusion.
                           1 Corinthians 13:1-3 
1.	Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal. 
2.	 And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing. 
3.	 And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.  
Note that the word though represents “Even if” because 
a.	Paul does not speak with the tongues of angels.
b.	Paul cannot have all the faith in this world. 
c.	Paul was not burned but rather beheaded.
So, Paul was saying even if he can speak with the tongues of angels, even if he have all faith in this world and even if he give his body to be burned and he does not have love, he is no one.
CREATED COUNTERFEIT
When you consider the hierarchy of the Gift of the spirit, the spirit of tongues comes last but the modern Christians of today have reverse the order, they see Christian who do not speak in the unknown tongues the speak us the second class people who have not been baptised by the holy spirit of God, But the Holy Spirit was not given to speak in tongue but rather strengthen us in our weakness so that we can proclaim the word of God with boldness to facilitate the second coming of Christ. Tongues only comes in when there is a language barrier which makes communication a problem. 
Do not be unaware that anything God create; the devil create counterfeit to blackmail God. God created a marriage to exist between males and females, but the devil has created one that both sexes can marry each other. So, Satan has also attached the true and biblical gift of Tongues to create a type where one word can be repeated over and over again. But in Matthew 6:7 (But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking) God is warning us to refrain from vain repetitions. This unknown tongue is a modernise paganism whose origin cannot be found in the Bible.
A CALL FROM BABYLON.
Revelation 18:2-4 “And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils. And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues” 
Genesis 11:7-9 “Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech.  So, the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city.  Therefore, is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth”.  
 Revelation 16:13 “And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet” 
Jesus is calling us from this deception, The main power of a frog and a serpent is the mouth, So God is calling us not to conform to the lure and deceptive from the speech of Satan that the unknown tongue is a heavenly language. Babel tower resulted in confusion not unity.
John 14:15-17 “If ye love me, keep my commandments.  And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;  Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you”.  
 The comforter was not a deceiver but someone who will lead us and other people into the truth. May God bless you and cause you to stand for Him.  AMEN
