  <p> <b> Why do we then keep the law if the law cannot save us. <br> </b>
When a student completes his senior high school course, he then chooses one tertiary institution and rest all his confidence that the school will give him his choice of program. after this, the school then sit to convey all these applications and decides on the students they want to give this admission offer to them. When this student is lucky to be offered the admission, he then signs an agreement with the institution to comply by all the rules in the school in order to complete the school successfully. Likewise, in the Christian life, the Grace of God saves the believer by faith from his bondage of sin. after this grace, the believer needs to obey the commandment of the justifier (Jesus Christ) to preserve his salvation till he will die. Note that is the believer knows when he will die, he will enjoy till when he is about to die before accepting Christ. so, the Bible said in <b><i>1 Corinthians</i></b> that the greatest enemy to be cast on the earth is death. meaning believers needs to obey the will of their maker till their death. </p>
<p> <b>“What shall I do to inherit eternal life?” <br></b>
the modern teachers of sanctiﬁcation would answer, <i> “Only believe that Jesus saves you.”</i> But when Christ was asked this question He said,  <b> “What is written in the law? </b> How readest thou?” And when the questioner replied, “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, ...and thy neighbour as thyself,” Jesus said, “Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt live” <b><i>(Luke 10:25-29).</i></b>  True sanctiﬁcation will be evidenced by a conscientious regard for all the commandments of God, by a careful improvement of every talent, by a circumspect conversation, by revealing in every act the meekness of Christ.</p>
<p><b> God's Law – A Mirror <br></b>
After a lady is done with her bath, she stands before a mirror to know which part of her face she must apply pomade, clean, or remove a dirt. This mirror has no power to do all these corrections, but it just points out where it needs correction.  The law, in like manner, can only condemn the sinner by giving him knowledge of his condition and then pointing him to the cross for true cleansing. “For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast” <b><i>(Ephesians 2:8,9)</i></b>. No sinner can gain favor and acceptance with God because he keeps the law. The law was not made for the purpose of saving or justifying. It was made to show us our need of cleansing and to point us to the great source of cleansing, Jesus Christ, our Lord. The Bible speaks of the law as a mirror to show us what kind of persons we really are. </p>
<p><b>The “New” Law of Christ</b><br>
Some try to dispose of the Ten Commandments based on the “new” commandments of love that Christ introduced. It is certainly true that Jesus laid down two great laws of love as a summary of all the law. When the lawyer asked Jesus, which was the greatest commandment in the law, he received the answer: “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it, thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets”<b><i> (Matthew 22:37–40).</i></b>  </p>
<p><b> Not Under the Law</b> <br>
Often, we hear this argument to belittle the law of God: “Well, since we are not under the law but under grace, we do not need to keep the Ten Commandments any longer.” Is this a valid point? The Bible certainly does say that we are not under the law, but does that imply that we are free from the obligation to obey it? The text is found in  <b><i>Romans 6:14, 15.</i></b> “For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace. What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbids.”  In the strongest possible language Paul states that being under grace does not give a license to break the law. Yet this is exactly what millions believe today, and they totally ignore Paul’s specific warning. <br>
Paul is not referring here primarily to any law in particular but to law as a principle. His point is that Christians are not under law as a way of salvation, but under grace. 
  Law cannot save a sinner, nor can law put an end to sin or its dominion. Law reveals sin, and because of the sinfulness of man, law, as it were, causes transgression to increase. Law cannot forgive sin, nor can law provide any power to overcome it. The sinner who seeks to be saved under law will find only condemnation and deeper enslavement to sin.
The offer to be under grace, thus, to have victory over sin, and the enabling power for the attainment of every virtue, have been extended to every one of the descendants of Adam <b><i>(John 3:16).</i></b> But many have blindly or stubbornly chosen to remain under law in their pride of self-righteousness are not willing to acknowledge their own helplessness and to surrender themselves wholly to the mercy and transforming grace of God. <br>
In a nutshell, Paul is saying that if a man is under law he remains also under the dominion of sin, for law cannot save one from either the condemnation or the power of sin. But those who are under grace receive not only release from condemnation <b><i>(Rom. 8:1)</i></b> but also power to overcome. Thus, sin no longer will have dominion over them.
 Have you ever been stopped by a policeman for exceeding the speed limit? It is an embarrassing experience, especially if you know you are guilty. But suppose you really were hurrying to meet a valid emergency, and you pour out your convincing explanation to the policeman as he writes your ticket. Slowly he folds the ticket and tears it up. Then he says, “All right, I’m going to pardon you this time, “but I don’t want to ever catch you speeding again.” Now what do you think he means by his statement? Surely, he was telling the person to obey the laws on the roads. Does this pardon (grace) open the way for you to disobey the law? Paul answered in Rom 3:31 that, we establish the law after the grace.
   Why, then, should any true Christian try to rationalize his way out of obeying the law of God? “If ye love me,” Jesus said, “keep my commandments” <b><i>(John 14:15).</i></b>  Before Jesus came, a sinner is under an obligation to offer a sheep anytime he commits sin, and this grace of Jesus has free man from this duty. </p>
<p><b> Obedience — The Test of Love <br></b>
Someone may bring up the objection that after the law has accomplished its purpose of pointing the sinner to Christ for cleansing, it will no longer be needed in the experience of the believer. Is that true? No, indeed. For example,   When a lady finish using her mirror to check her dressing, she does not say I have finish using the mirror so I should throw it away, she keeps the mirror for the future so that anytime she want to check her dressing she will go for it. Likewise, the Christian will always need the watchdog of the law to reveal any deviation from the true path and to point him back to the cleansing cross of Jesus. <br>
      Law and grace do not work in competition with each other but in perfect cooperation. The law points out sin, and grace saves from sin. The law is the will of God, and grace is the power to do the will of God. We do not obey the law in order to be saved but because we are saved. A beautiful text which combines the two in their true relationship is <b><i> Revelation 14:12.</i></b> “Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.” <br>
      The works of obedience are the real test of love. Therefore, they are so necessary in the experience of a true believer. “Faith without works is dead” <b><i> (James 2:20).</i></b> No man ever won a fair maiden’s heart by words alone. Had there been no flowers, no acts of devotion, no gifts of love, most men would still be searching for a companion. Jesus said, “Not everyone that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven”  <b><i>(Matthew 7:21).</i></b> 
       One of the strongest texts in the Bible on this subject is found in 1 John 2:4. “He that saith, I know him, and keepnet not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.” John could write that with such assurance because it is one of the most deeply established truths in the Bible. Jesus spoke of those who said, “Lord, Lord,” but did not do the will of the Father. Then He described many who would seek entrance to the kingdom claiming to be workers of miracles in the name of Christ. But He would sorrowfully have to say, “I never knew you: depart from me” <b><i>(Matthew 7:21–23).</i></b> You see, to know Christ is to love Him, and to love Him is to obey Him. </p> 
    <p><b>Is It Possible to Obey the Law? <br></b> 
Countless Christians have been taught that since the law is spiritual and we are carnal, no human being will ever be able in this life to meet the requirements of the perfect law. Is this true? Has it been given by God as a great idealistic, impossible goal toward which converted souls should struggle but never expect to attain? Is there some hidden reservation or secret meaning in the many commands to obey the ten great rules God wrote on stone? Did God mean what He said and say what He meant?  <br>
Many believe that only Christ could have obeyed that law and only because He had special powers that have not been made available to us. Certainly, it is true that Jesus is the only One who lived without committing a single act of disobedience. His reason for living that perfect, victorious life is laid out in <b><i>Romans 8:3, 4:</i></b> “For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh: That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh but after the Spirit.”  <br>
Do not miss the point that Jesus came to condemn sin by His perfect life in the flesh in order that “the righteousness of the law” might be fulfilled in us. What is that righteousness?  Paul said, “I can do all things through Christ which strengthened me” <b><i>(Philippians 4:13).</i></b> This means that with the power of God believers who take Christ at His word can obey all what the scripture says. </p>
<p><b>Judged by the Law <br></b>
Now, a final question about the subject of the law: How many of the Ten Commandments does one have to break to be guilty of sin? James says, “For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all. James said that all men shall be judged by the law of liberty” <b><i>(James 2:10–12).  </i></b>
“Blessed are they that do His commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life and may enter in through the gates into the city” <b><i>(Revelation 22:14).</i></b> <br> 
          To break one is to be guilty of sin. The Bible indicates that the Ten Commandments are like a chain with ten links. When one link is broken, the chain is broken. So, it is with the law. Those who stand in the judgment will have to meet the acid test of the Ten Commandments. If a practicing thief should seek entrance into the kingdom, he would be rejected. Therefore, Paul says thieves will not inherit the heavenly city. Furthermore, the Bible specifically declares that liars, adulterers, idolaters, and covetous men will not be in the kingdom. Why? Because the Ten Commandments forbid those things, and men will be judged finally by that law. Not one person will be admitted into heaven who is wilfully violating any one of the Ten Commandments, because breaking one is breaking all. </b> 
 <p><b>Can I be saved if I know the truth? <br></b>
Those who profess to keep the law of God and yet at heart are indulging in sin are condemned by the True Witness. They claim to be rich in a knowledge of the truth; but they are not in harmony with its sacred principles. The truth does not sanctify their lives. God’s Word declares that the professed commandment-keeper whose life contradicts his faith is blind, wretched, poor, and naked. God’s law is the mirror presenting a complete reﬂection of the man as he is and holding up before him the correct likeness. Some will turn away and forget this picture, while others will employ abusive epithets against the law, as though this would cure their defects of character. Still others who are condemned by the law will repent of their transgressions and, through faith in Christ’s merits, will perfect Christian character. 
If you only Know the truth you are not sanctified. Sanctification is only gained through obedience to the will of God. i.e. Allowing God to transform us rather than just claiming righteous in our own sight. </p>
